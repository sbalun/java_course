*--------------*
|  Abstraction |
* -------------*
 - The reserved word, abstract, is a non-access modifier that can be used on classes and methods.
 - Used when you want to define a template for a class or a method, but do not intend for it to be used as is.
 - Not designed to be instantiated.  Meant to be extended.  Subclass must implement.
